Foreword
The African Regional Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO) is an African Intergovernmental organization made of Member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Union (AU). One of the fundamental mandates of ARSO is the establishment of a conformity assessment system to promote the quality of African goods and services as a means of facilitating intra-African trade as well as accessing global markets.
The ARSO Conformity Assessment Programme (ACAP) is supported by a coherent set of documents which are developed under the auspices of the ARSO Conformity Assessment Committee (ARSO CACO) which comprises experts from Member States. Member States participate in the committee on a voluntary basis and the documents developed follow the principles and procedures for the development of African Standards outlined in the African Standards Harmonization Model (ASHAM) with the exception of the stages and voting thresholds. Being conformity assessment instruments, ACAP documents are subject to dynamic adaptations which must timeously respond to changes in the conformity assessment fields.
ACAP documents will be revised on a flexible basis to fit in with changes in global conformity assessment systems.

Introduction
This document specifies requirements, the observance of which is intended to ensure that certification bodies operate certification schemes in a competent, consistent and impartial manner, thereby facilitating the recognition of such bodies and the acceptance of certified products, processes and services on a national and international basis and so furthering international trade.
This document describes the procedure for the approval of National and International third party Certification Bodies (CB from now on) willing to be recognized as certifiers for the ACAP.
It summarizes the requirements which must be met by a CB, to be engaged in the evaluation and certification process for the ACAP and award of the ACAP Mark.
The ARSO Secretariat will grant approval or disapproval for the CB to become recognized CB for ACAP, based on accreditation
This document includes the rules to be complied with by National and International third party Certification Bodies seeking accreditation under ACAP.
There are some basic principles that represent a “Must” in the development of the ACAP, in order to make a product identified with the ACAP Mark more “Robust” and acknowledgeable by the interested parties:
(a)
The level of control exercised by ARSO on the ACAP Certification system in order to guarantee the effectiveness and integrity of the system
(b)
Independence of the Certification Bodies involved in the process and the transparency of the whole system.
(c)
Clear Rules in order to guarantee and assess the competence of the CBs to carry out evaluation
(d)
Definition of auditing criteria and qualification of the auditors (training/background).
(e)
Technical support for capacity building within all the involved parties
(f)
The Supply chain coverage and Traceability requirements: the possibility to track the ACAP Mark along the supply chain and how to do that
Interested parties can expect or require the certification body to meet all the requirements of the ACAP, as well as those of the specific ACAP certification schemes.
Parties that may have an interest in certification include, but are not limited to:
⎯
the clients of the certification bodies;
⎯
the customers of the organizations whose products, processes or services are certified;
⎯
governmental authorities;
⎯
non-governmental organizations; and
⎯
Consumers and other members of the public.

Foreword
The African Regional Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO) is an African Intergovernmental organization made of Member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Union (AU). One of the fundamental mandates of ARSO is the establishment of a conformity assessment system to promote the quality of African goods and services as a means of facilitating intra-African trade as well as accessing global markets.
The ARSO Conformity Assessment Programme (ACAP) is supported by a coherent set of documents which are developed under the auspices of the ARSO Conformity Assessment Committee (ARSO CACO) which comprises experts from Member States. Member States participate in the committee on a voluntary basis and the documents developed follow the principles and procedures for the for harmonisation of African Standards and other deliverables (SHP-01) with the exception of the stages and voting thresholds. Being conformity assessment instruments, ACAP documents are subject to dynamic adaptations which must timeously respond to changes in the conformity assessment fields.
ACAP documents will be revised on a flexible basis to fit in with changes in global conformity assessment systems.

12.5 Document review and on-site audits
On receipt of the completed, Application Form and Questionnaire, signature of the agreements and payment of the appropriate fee, the Certification Body will confirm to the applicant the date of the document review and on-site audit, according to the rules set by the ACAP.
12.5.1 Documental review
All the documentation required by the Certification Scheme and the specific Standard must be available the day of the audit. This activity can be done on-site or remotely.
12.5.2 On-site announced audits
During these audits, the implementation of the requirements of the standard and internal procedures is checked for compliance. Production activities and Records are verified as evidence of implementation. The possibility for sampling of sites, products and processes is specified in the general rules of the specific Certification Scheme and Standard. The on-site announced audits include:
(a) Initial (First certification) audit,
(b) Surveillance audits
This is carried out to confirm the validity of the certificate, in the subsequent 2 years, within maximum 12 months from the date of the initial Certification, a new Certification must be carried out. Usually, the due date for the planning of the surveillance audit is corresponding to the date of the initial certification audit +1 year, but, according to the cycle of the different products included in the certification and to the seasons, the surveillance audits can be carried out in a timeframe of 5 months (3 months before and 2 months after surveillance due date).

The level of non-conformity assigned by an auditor against a requirement of the Standard is an objective judgement with respect to severity and risk and is based on evidence collected and observations made during the audit.
12.6.1 Major non-conformance
There is a substantial failure to meet the requirements of any clause of the ARSO Standard or with the Operator’s own internal procedures. The situation is identified which would, on the basis of available objective evidence, raise significant doubt as to the conformity of the certified product.
This kind of deviation results with the stop of the certification process and require for the operator to analyse the causes of the non-conformity, prepare a corrective actions action plan and implement corrective actions. Corrective actions need to be completed and verified and approved by the CB within the following timeframe:
12.6.1.1 Initial (First certification) audit
Document Review (where applicable): before initial on-site audit
On-site evaluation: within 90 days from the last day of the audit.
The exceeding of the 90 days without closing all Major NC raised during the initial audit (both documentation and on-site) will lead to the full repetition of the audits.
12.6.1.2 Surveillance and re-certification audits
On-site annual evaluation: 28 days from the last day of audit. Depending on the severity of the non-conformity, with respect to safety and legality of the product, the time can be reduced down to 0 days and lead to immediate suspension of the certificate.
The exceeding of the given time without closing all Major NC raised during the surveillance audit will lead to the full repetition of the audit.
12.6.2 Minor non-conformance
Where a clause has not been fully met but, on the basis of objective evidence, the conformity of the product is not in doubt.
A Minor non-conformance is allocated for an individual failure to meet the requirements of any clause of the African Standard or with the operator’s own internal procedures, or if a series of minor but related discrepancies are observed, which together are judged to be acceptable, without constituting an overall failure in the area concerned.
This kind of deviation requires the operator to prepare a corrective actions action plan and implement corrective actions. Corrective actions need to be completed and verified and approved by the CB within the following timeframe:
(a) Initial (First certification) audit.
Document Review (where applicable): before initial on-site audit.
On-site evaluation: within 90 days from the last day of the audit.
The exceeding of the 90 days without closing all Minor NC raised during the initial audit (both documentation and on-site) will lead to the full repetition of the audit. Some tolerance about the closing of Minor NCs can be found for the different ACAP Certification Schemes and is specified in ACAP 1-2.
(b) Surveillance and re-certification audits
On-site annual evaluation: 28 days from the last day of audit.
ACAP 1-1:2025

12.6.3 Observation
One or more partial deviations to fulfil requirements of the following types:
(a) Formalities / documentary: In the interpretation of a requirement of the Standard and / or in the formalization of records
(b) Operational: in the application of the requirements of the Standard and / or the documentation of the system;
(c) these should not, however, raise doubts about the real effectiveness of the system (the ability of the system to provide a product in compliance with the Control Points and relate Compliance Criteria) and will not have any influence on the proceeding of the certification process.
12.7 Follow up audit
In case of non-conformities raised during the certification activities, the operator will receive a given time for implementation of corrective actions. The time allowed for closure changes according to the Scheme of certification.
The follow up audit is planned to verify the management of non-conformities raised during the previous audit and the corrective action implemented by the operator.
Corrective actions can be evaluated on-site, by a physical audit, or in remotely by a desk audit of documentation evidences sent by the operator to the Auditor. The decision on how to carry out the follow up depends on the kind on NC raised, the number of Major NCs and also the possibility to effectively assess the corrective action remotely.

Foreword
The African Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO) is an African Intergovernmental organization made of Member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Union (AU). One of the fundamental mandates of ARSO is the establishment of a conformity assessment system to promote the quality of African goods and services as a means of facilitating intra-African trade as well as accessing global markets.
The ARSO Conformity Assessment Programme (ACAP) is supported by a coherent set of documents which are developed under the auspices of the ARSO Conformity Assessment Committee (ARSO CACO) which comprises experts from Member States. Member States participate in the committee on a voluntary basis and the documents developed follow the principles and procedures for the for harmonisation of African Standards and other deliverables (SHP-01) with the exception of the stages and voting thresholds. Being conformity assessment instruments, ACAP documents are subject to dynamic adaptations which must timeously respond to changes in the conformity assessment fields.
ACAP documents will be revised on a flexible basis to fit in with changes in global conformity assessment systems.

5 Basic requirements for standards in ACAP certification schemes
In order to meet the objective of ACAP, the transparency, robustness and consistency of the certification process and the related schemes of certification is a critical factor to be taken into consideration.
A product certification scheme is composed by a set of rules, procedures and management for carrying out certification, related to specified products, to which the same specified requirements, specific rules and procedures apply.
A product certification scheme may use defined rules, procedures and management, which could be unique to the scheme or could be defined in a product certification system applicable to a number of schemes. It is always necessary to have a product certification scheme, but only necessary to separately define a product certification system if the same rules, procedures and management are to be used for more than one scheme. This is the case of the ARSO Conformity Assessment Programme, where more certification schemes are included and more African Standards are linked to the same certification scheme.
Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between product certification system, product certification schemes and African Standards.

⎯
Auditing on of implementation of sustainable fishery practices.
The present certification scheme is applicable to the African Standards included in Scheme F.
Annex F provides detailed criteria to be applied for design and general rules for audit and certification.
5.7 Scheme G: Good financial grant practice certification
The objective of this standard for Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP) is to standardize, simplify and strengthen the financial governance of grant funding. For grantors, they can use the standard as a minimum requirement to their grantees. For grantees, they can claim compliance with this standard to support applications for grants from grantors. This standard is to establish a consistent approach to the management of grants throughout the grant life cycle, for the benefit of grantors and grantees.
Operating in compliance to the standard should:
(a) reduce the cost and administration time for both grantors and grantees;
(b) reduce the multitude of audits and financial evaluations that grantees have from different grantors;
(c) increase the confidence of grantors to fund directly to grantees;
(d) reduce the risk of corruption, bribery and fraud; and
(e) enable targeted financial capacity building by grantors
This standard is designed to codify and provide requirements on established good practice. It is a quality standard and not an accounting standard. The GFGP standard provides a common framework for how grantees shall financially manage grants. It provides details of the requirements, specifications and criteria to be applied, to implement good financial grant practice.
Grantors and grantees are very diverse in nature, and range from:
(a) very large to very small;
(b) straightforward to very complex;
(c) short to longer term in nature;
(d) operating in safe to risky environments;
(e) having different levels of risk they are willing to accept;
(f) government to private foundations and individual entities;
(g) national to regional to international in nature; and
(h) mature to new and emerging.
The standard is designed to be inclusive of all the above by having four tiers from bronze to platinum. Table 1 is illustrative only and gives some indication of the types of organizations that might fit into each tier.
The tiers are cumulative from bronze through to platinum. Therefore, for an organization to achieve silver compliance, it will be required to comply with all of the requirements within the bronze and silver tiers. For an organization to achieve gold compliance, the organization will be required to comply with all of the requirements within the bronze, silver and gold tiers. To achieve platinum compliance, the organization will be required to comply with all of the requirements in this standard.
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
The four tiers have been designed to encourage grantees to progressively strengthen their financial grant practices as their organization develops.
The four tiers also enable grantors to manage their exposure to risk as some grantors may choose to specify grantees comply with a certain tier, or parts of a tier, depending on the size or nature of the grants that they manage and are responsible for. Grantors may, after an aaudit, decide to award the grant, even if the grantee does not meet their requirements and may mitigate their risk by putting in place additional financial controls, or provide capacity strengthening funding to bring the grantee up to the required level.
This standard addresses the principles of good financial grant practice, which are:
(i)
accountability;
(ii)
stewardship;
(iii)
compliance to standards;
(iv)
transparency;
(v)
viability;
(vi)
integrity;
(vii)
consistency and
(viii)
efficiency and effectiveness
Table 1 — Organization activity indicative of GFGP tiers
In turn, these principles are supported by four key pillars of good financial management, which, if correctly applied, will provide the evidence to support compliance with good financial grant practice. These are:
(i)
Internal controls
(ii)
Record keeping
(iii)
Planning
(iv)
Monitoring
Further detail on both the principles of good financial grant practice and four key pillars of good financial management can be found in ARS 1651, Good financial grant practice — Requirements.
Annex G provides detailed criteria to be applied for design and general rules for audit and certification.

(a) To control whether open nonconformities that prevented a positive certification decision are addressed, closed, and verified for efficacy, to allow the certificate to be issued or maintained
(b) To determine whether the organization has reached the minimum performance level and the certificate may be issued or maintained.
(c) If during a follow-up audit, an audited organization does not comply, the certificate is not issued or suspended. This audited organization may not be subject to additional follow-upaudits for the next six months and a complete new audit of the same level of the failed audit (surveillance or re-certification) is needed to re-activate the certificate.
42 © ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
(d) Organizations with nonconformities on any of the zero-tolerance criteria are not eligible for a foll0w-up audit. The certificate is not issued, suspended or is cancelled. This audited organization may not be subject to additional follow-up audits for the next twelve months. A new complete Certification process must be started (document review and Initial audit)
(e) A follow-upaudit may take place remotely, when it is possible to evaluate the improvement actions through documents or remote interviews with farm management or group administrator representatives.
D.6.3.8 Investigation audit
Investigation audits are carried out in response to a complaint, reported incident, or substantial information regarding the performance of a certified organization relating to one or more critical criteria of a ACAP AES Standard.
An investigation audit may be carried out at any time, when the CB determines there is sufficient evidence of a potential nonconformity. The certified organization may be subject to a desk investigation audit only if it is possible to demonstrate conformity through documents.
Investigation audits are unannounced. However, the certified organization may be given advanced warning (no more than two working days), when doing so can avoid significant logistical obstacles and the issue at hand cannot be influenced by an advanced warning.
The CB bears the cost of investigation audits. However, should the complaint, reported incident, or substantial information be confirmed, the cost of these audits may be charged to the certified organization.
D.6.3.9 Scope expansion audit
The objective of a scope expansion audit is to assess compliance with certification rules for new areas, activities or member farms that a certified organization wishes to add to its scope before a re-certification or surveillance audit.
All applicable criteria of the ARS/AES standard relevant for the certification are evaluated for the new areas or for a sample of new member farms (in the case of group administrators), as well as for new crops or cattle species.
D.6.4 Audit timing
D.6.4.1 Timing for initial certification audit

D.8 Audit results and evaluation of compliance
D.8.1 Continuous improvement criteria
ARS/AES Standards contain a continuous improvement system that requires certified legal entities (ex: farmers, processors, tourism operators) to gradually increase their compliance over four performance levels.
The specific binding level requirements (Tiers) will not change under any condition, including suspension or cancellation of a certificate, modification of scope or the change of a CB.
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
D.8.2 The Maturity Model of ACAP AES certification scheme
The Performance Tiers provide a framework for operators (Operators, processors, tourism operators, etc.) to improve their compliance levels in line with the continual improvement principles. These tiers provide opportunities for operators to invest gradually as well as for small-scale operators to engage in the certification process at affordable rates.
D.8.3 Management plan
The management plan, in this respect called the Operator Sustainability Plan (PSP) is an organizational tool for determining baseline performance levels, identifying a roadmap for continual improvement, and for achieving and documenting improvements in the environmental, social, and economic performance of the operation. The contents of the management plan:
(a) Organized according to environmental, social, and economic factors.
(b) Describes the operation's land, resources, and current practices, including baseline information on the status of Indicators relevant for the ARS/AES Standard to be applied.
(c) Identifies critical criteria and indicators the operator must monitor to maintain or improve performance.
(d) Records goals for meeting criteria and improving performance.
(e) Documents strategies implemented, results observed, and outcomes achieved.
(f) Identifies any unexpected outcomes or problems, as well as plans for mitigating or improving outcomes for the next cycle.
D.8.4 Classification of findings
Regarding scheme D Critical Non-Conformance. This is a Major non-conformance raised against a Required Indicator of a Critical Criteria.
D.8.5 Critical criteria
Critical criteria cover the highest-priority and highest-risk environmental, social and labour issues. Single Operators and group administrators are required to comply with all applicable critical criteria at all time as a condition to grant or maintain the certificate.
Zero-tolerance critical criteria. Failing to comply with any of the Required Indicators related to the following zero-tolerance criteria results in the denial or the immediate cancellation of the certificate:
(a) No destruction of High Conservation Value areas
(b) No forced / slave labour
(c) No mistreatment of workers
(d) No sexual harassment
(e) No discrimination
(f) No worst forms of child labour
Critical criteria are identified with “C” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
46 © ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
D.8.6 Level of performance indicators
There are three categories of Indicators to be addressed and complied to achieve and maintain certification against one or more ARS/AES Standards:
(a) Required Indicators. These indicators are critical for compliance and achievement of the certificate and include indicators that are linked to Critical criteria. Compliance to 100% of these indicators is required to complete (o maintain) the certification cycle. Required indicators change according to the different ARS/AES Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification Tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. Required Indicators are identified with “R” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
(i)
Non-Conformances raised against a Required indicator linked to a Critical Criteria must be scored as Critical non-conformance and cannot be closed with a Follow Up audit and results in the denial or the immediate cancellation of the certificate. It will not be possible to receive a new audit before six months. New audit must be carried out by the same
(ii)
Non-Conformances raised against a Required indicator linked to other criteria must be scored as Major non-conformance and must be all closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for initial certification). Failure to complete effective corrective actions within the given timeframe will results in the denial or the suspension of the certificate until satisfactory corrective actions are completed.
(b) General Indicators. These indicators are considered fundamental for compliance and achievement of the certificate. Compliance to minimum 80% of these indicators, applicable for the scope, is required to complete (or maintain) the certification cycle. General indicators change according to the different ARS/AES Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification Tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. General Indicators are identified with “G” in the different ARS/AES Standards
Non-compliances raised against a General Indicator may be scored as Major or Minor non-conformity, or Observation, according to categorization given in ARS/AES 1.
(i)
Minor Non-Conformances must be closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for Initial certification) up to the minimum requirement of 80% of compliance for the specific tier of certification. For the remaining 20% a corrective action plan shall be proposed and approved by the Auditor within the same timeframe, corrective actions assessed during the next following audit. If at the end of the following audit some Minor non-conformance are not closed with corrective actions, these will be added to the new Minor non-conformances raised during the audit.
(ii)
Observations do not have influence on the final certification but must be taken into consideration and implemented for continual improvement
(c) Optional Indicators. These indicators are considered for continual improvement. Compliance to minimum 20% of these indicators, applicable for the scope, is required to complete (o maintain) the certification cycle. Optional indicators change according to the different ARS/AES Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification Tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. Optional Indicators are identified with “O” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
Non-compliances raised against an Optional Indicator may be scored as Minor non-conformity, or Observation, according to categorization given in ARS/AES 1.
(i)
Minor Non-Conformances must be all closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for Initial certification) up to the minimum requirement of 20% of compliance for the specific tier of certification. For the remaining 80% a corrective action plan shall be proposed and approved by the Auditor within the same timeframe, corrective actions must be completed before the next re-certification audit.

F.3 Audit results and evaluation of compliance
F.3.1 Continuous improvement criteria
ARS/AES Standards contain a continuous improvement system that requires certified legal entities to gradually increase their compliance over four performance levels.
The specific binding level requirements (Tiers) will not change under any condition, including suspension or cancellation of a certificate, modification of scope or the change of a CB.
F.3.2 The Maturity Model of ACAP AES certification scheme
The Performance Tiers provide a framework for operators to improve their compliance levels in line with the continual improvement principles. These tiers provide opportunities for operators to invest gradually as well as for small-scale operators to engage in the certification process at affordable rates.
F.3.3 Management plan
The management plan, in this respect called the Operator Sustainability Plan (PSP) is an organizational tool for determining baseline performance levels, identifying a roadmap for continual improvement, and for achieving and documenting improvements in the environmental, social, and economic performance of the operation. The contents of the management plan:
(a) Organized according to environmental, social, and economic factors.
(b) Describes the operation's land, resources, and current practices, including baseline information on the status of indicators relevant for the ARS/AES Standard to be applied.
(c) Identifies critical criteria and indicators the operator must monitor to maintain or improve performance.
(d) Records goals for meeting criteria and improving performance.
(e) Documents strategies implemented, results observed, and outcomes achieved.
(f) Identifies any unexpected outcomes or problems, as well as plans for mitigating or improving outcomes for the next cycle.
F.3.4 Classification of findings
Regarding scheme F, Critical Non-Conformance. This is a Major non-conformance raised against a Required Indicator of a Critical Criteria.
F.3.5 Critical criteria
Critical criteria cover the highest-priority and highest-risk environmental, social and labour issues. Single Operators and group administrators are required to comply with all applicable critical criteria at all time as a condition to grant or maintain the certificate.
Zero-tolerance critical criteria. Failing to comply with any of the Required Indicators related to the following zero-tolerance criteria results in the denial or the immediate cancellation of the certificate:
(a) No destruction of High Conservation Value areas
(b) No forced / slave labour
(c) No mistreatment of workers
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
(d) No sexual harassment
(e) No discrimination
(f) No worst forms of child labour
Critical criteria are identified with “C” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
F.3.6 Level of performance indicators
There are three categories of Indicators to be addressed and complied to achieve and maintain certification against one or more ARS/AES Standards:
(a) Required Indicators. These indicators are critical for compliance and achievement of the certificate and include indicators that are linked to Critical criteria. Compliance to 100% of these indicators is required to complete (or maintain) the certification cycle. Required indicators change according to the different ARS/AES Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. Required Indicators are identified with “R” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
(i) Non-Conformances raised against a Required indicator linked to a Critical Criteria must be scored as Critical non-conformance and cannot be closed with a Follow Up audit and results in the denial or the immediate cancellation of the certificate. It will not be possible to receive a new audit before six months. New audit must be carried out by the same audit team.
(ii) Non-Conformances raised against a Required indicator linked to other criteria must be scored as Major non-conformance and must be all closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for initial certification). Failure to complete effective corrective actions within the given timeframe will results in the denial or the suspension of the certificate until satisfactory corrective actions are completed. Considering the complexity of possible missing data to be retrieved, the time interval allowed for the correction of non-conformities is extended to 6 months.
(b) General Indicators. These indicators are considered fundamental for compliance and achievement of the certificate. Compliance to minimum 80% of these indicators, applicable for the scope, is required to complete (or maintain) the certification cycle. General indicators change according to the different ARS/AES Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. General Indicators are identified with “G” in the different ARS/AES Standards
(i) Non-compliances raised against a General Indicator may be scored as Major or Minor non-conformity, or Observation.
(ii) Minor Non-Conformances must be closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for Initial certification) up to the minimum requirement of 80% of compliance for the specific tier of certification. For the remaining 20% a corrective action plan shall be proposed and approved by the Auditor within the same timeframe, corrective actions assessed during the next following audit. If at the end of the following audit some Minor non-conformance are not closed with corrective actions, these will be added to the new Minor non-conformances raised during the audit. Each corrective action must be fully implemented within a year.
(iii) Observations do not have influence on the final certification but must be taken into consideration and implemented for continual improvement.
(c) Optional Indicators. These indicators are considered for continual improvement. Compliance to minimum 20% of these indicators, applicable for the scope, is required to complete (or maintain) the certification cycle. Optional indicators change according to the different ARS/AES
62 © ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
Standards and their number increases with increasing of the certification tiers, from Bronze to Platinum. Optional Indicators are identified with “O” in the different ARS/AES Standards.
(i) Non-compliances raised against an Optional Indicator may be scored as Minor non-conformity, or Observation, according to categorization given in respective standards.
(ii) Minor Non-Conformances must be all closed with effective corrective action and Follow Up audit within 28 days (90 days for Initial certification) up to the minimum requirement of 20% of compliance for the specific tier of certification. For the remaining 80% a corrective action plan shall be proposed and approved by the Auditor within the same timeframe, corrective actions must be completed before the next re-certification audit. However, during the inspection all the aspects concerning these requirements will be checked and each deficiency will be highlighted in the Auditing Report as a recommendation. The Company shall evaluate the possible necessity of implementing corrective measures and, within the following inspection, shall inform the Certification Body regarding the decisions taken and the corrective measures implemented.
(iii) Observations do not have influence on the final certification but must be taken into consideration and implemented for continual improvement

F.5 Certification of ARS/AES 2, aquaculture and chain of custody
F.5.1 Certification of ARS/AES 2 and aquaculture
The certification process consists of three main stages (See Figure 1 below)
1) Audit;
2) Review;
3) Decision.
F.5.1.1 The Initial Audit phase consists of two phases:
a) Preliminary phase (S1);
b) Audit implementation phase (S2).
F.5.1.2 The preliminary phase (S1) aims to:
a) Audit the documentation of the firm management system;
b) Assess the firm site location and characteristics and exchange information with the firm’s staff in order to assess whether the audit implementation phase, S2 can be started;
c) Review the firm’s understanding of the regulations’ requirements, particularly related to the identification of key aspects, processes, objectives and functioning of the management system;
d) Gather the necessary information about areas of interest of the management system, processes, and location(s) of the firm, including related legal aspects and compliance to the regulation (e.g. regarding quality, environment, legal aspects related to the firm’s activity, associated risks, etc.);
e) Review the allocation of resources for S2 and develop a plan with the firm for S2;
f) Plan S2, create a detailed document of the firm’s management system, activities, and sites;
g) Check if the implementation of the management system indicates the firm is ready for the S2 audit.
A part of the S1 may take place at firm’s head offices. Once S1 is completed with positive outcome, it is possible to proceed directly to S2.
ACAP 1-2:2025

Figure F.1: Steps for issuance and maintenance of certification2
Audit implementation phase (S2):
During S2, the implementation and efficiency of the firm’s management system are assessed. This phase shall be carried out at the firm’s site(s) where the processes subjected to certification take place, and shall include an audit of the following:
a) Compliance of the management system to all the legislative requirements;
b) Activities of monitoring, measuring, reporting and reviewing in accordance to the fundamental objectives and goals of the firm;
c) The firm’s management system and its compliance against the legal requirements;
d) The firm’s control of the processes;
2 FOS 0001, Certification Procedure — FOS-Aqua, FOS-Wild, FOS-FF, FOS-FM, FOS-FO, FOS-O3 and CoC General requirements
66 © ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
e) The firm’s governance;
f) Links between regulation requirements, policy, objectives and goals of the firm, all the applicable legal requirements, responsibilities, staff competences, activities, and procedures;
g) Internal audits and review by the firm’s management.
Audits are carried out according to the principles outlined in ISO 19011.
F.5.2 Certification- CoC
All companies processing certified products shall undergo a Chain of Custody (CoC) audit. The chain of custody standard applies to each step of the supply chain. In the case of companies and/or subcontractors (service providers) only trading, distributing or storing certified tamper-proof, packaged products, the audit is not necessary.
The certification process for Chain of Custody (CoC) consists of three main stages detailed in F.5.1.
F.5.3 Subcontractors and suppliers
Subcontracted operators (i.e. fish farms, fishing vessels and processors) working on behalf of the firm and responsible for the production of the product to be certified, shall be included in the scope of certification.
Subcontracted activities that fall within the scope of the certification shall be declared during application, to allow the CBs to schedule audits at these premises. There shall be a contract between the firm and all subcontractors responsible for the production of the product to be certified, as the firm is responsible for the compliance of all subcontracting company to ACAP standards. CBs are responsible for verifying the existence of those contracts before starting the certification process.
Suppliers are independently certified operators that own a valid ACAP certification. Suppliers do not need to be included in the scope of certification of a processor seeking ACAP CoC certification when they own a valid ACAP certification.
F.5.4 Certification of operator group
The certification of operator or processor group is authorized when:
(1) All operators or processors in the group belong to the same legal entity, and/or
(2) All group members implement a common management system (e.g. evaluation of escapes, farming practices, traceability of the batch, equipment maintenance, etc).
In the latter case, there shall be written contracts in force between each operator member and the legal entity of the operator group. The group shall undertake internal audits of all members, covering all products under the certification scope to ensure compliance with the certification requirements. The internal audits shall include minimum one internal audit of the management system and of one internal audit covering 50% of all group members per year. The group is the certificate holder once certified. If individual members of a operator or processor group leave the group, the certificate is not valid for that member, and its products cannot carry the label anymore.
New operators may be added to a certificate in effect. If it corresponds to 10% or less, this addition can be done with an internal audit. It is the responsibility of the certificate holder to update the CB and ARSO on any addition or change of group members. The newly added operators shall be audited during the subsequent audit. If it corresponds to more than 10%, the audit shall be carried out by a CB.
The CB does not inspect all operators or production sites, but just a sample. Hence, the CB shall assess whether the internal controls of the group are appropriate.
ACAP 1-2:2025

F.5.5 Non-conformities and corrective actions
From the date of the onsite audit, the CB shall produce the audit report within 15 working days. Non-conformities (NCs) detected during the audit shall be reported by the auditor to the firm and to ARSO. The firm is responsible to address and solve all NCs detected during the audit before the issue of the certification.
▪
In the case of Major NCs: The company requesting the certification shall be 100% compliant with essential requirements to be recommended for certification by the certification body. The certificate cannot be granted if the company has a major NC that is not closed.
▪
In the case of Minor NCs: To be recommended for certification by the certification body, the company shall:
(a) Elaborate a corrective action plan to come into compliance with all important requirements: within maximum three weeks from the date of audit of the NCs, the company shall submit a proposal to carry out the corrective actions to the satisfaction of the certification body. In the proposal, the company shall include the timeframe for the implementation of each corrective action, considering that all minor NCs must be closed before the surveillance audit. The proposal shall be analysed by the certification body regarding its consistency and feasibility. If accepted, the certificate can be granted.
(b) Resolve all minor NCs reported in the corrective action plan which are verified in the surveillance audit: the company must have complied with the approved proposal. If the approved proposal has not been fully implemented, the certificate is suspended until the resolution of any remaining minor NCs.
The firm shall plan and implement corrective actions (CAs) in the appropriate timeframe.
CBs are responsible for the communication of the NCs, for their implementation within the appropriate timeframe, and for their audit and approval. The auditor shall report any NCs in the audit report together with evidence of non-compliance. The CAs are considered completed for the purpose of certification only when their implementation is verified and approved by the auditor.
The CB shall report non-conformities according to the latest ACAP CAR template and related evidence of CA implementation together with the audit report to ARSO.
F.5.6 Decision
The CB shall make the decision of granting a certification within a maximum of 30 working days after closure of any outstanding NCs. The decision is based on the amount and type of NCs recorded, if any, during the audit, and on any other relevant information given. The requirement for firms to solve NCs before gaining certification depends on the level of the NC.
ARSO Secretariat shall be informed of audit outcomes alongside the complete audit report and a copy of any certificates.
F.5.7 Issue of certificates
The CBs issue the certificates, which are valid for three years and shall include the following minimum information:

F.5.10.1 Surveillance audit
A surveillance audit shall be carried out by the CB to ensure certified companies maintain certification standards. The first surveillance audit shall be carried out within 12 months from the certificate issue. In the case of justified impediments (e.g. delayed fishing season), the CB may request for authorization to postpone surveillance audits for a maximum period of 90 days after the due date. Where possible and subject to fishery restrictions surveillance audits shall be carried out within 18 months from each recertification audit.
F.5.10.2 Recertification audit
Recertification audits shall be carried out at the end of the certificate’s period of validity, i.e. three (3) years. The CB shall inspect the complete checklist (Essential/ Required, General and Optional requirements) of the applicable standard(s) during all audits.
Recertification audits are mainly focused on the NCs identified during the initial audit and on the CAs. Audits also review any additions to the management system, fishing boats or aquaculture sites previously not sampled. Audits shall follow the requirements of ISO 19011.
F.5.10.3 Unannounced audits
Unannounced audits come in addition to the initial, surveillance or recertification audits of the three-year certification cycle. Therefore, these are additional audits and shall be carried out without significant advance warning. The CB shall inform the firm staff with a maximum of two working days before the intended visit.
The CBs shall specify in the contract with certified companies the possibility of undergoing unannounced audits and that related costs shall be covered by the company subject to the audit. Annually, 3% of the companies certified by the CB in the previous year must undergo unannounced audits. This monitoring shall be carried out in a diversified manner, aiming to include at least one company certified according to each African standard. Audits shall follow the requirements of ISO 19011.
F.5.11 Certification suspension and cancellation
During a certification contract, the CB can suspend the firm’s certification for the following reasons:
a) A wrong or misleading use or advertisement of the certification by the company;
b) The company refuses or hinders the audit activities;
c) The company fails to meet the financial obligations defined by the contract with the CB;
d) The auditor detects major NCs that the firms are not able to solve (e.g. stock status);
e) The company fails to carry out any CAs following NCs detected by the CB;
f) Unlicensed use of the ARSO logo or failure to pay the annual fee for the logo use.
The CB shall inform the firm about the time period within which the CAs shall be undertaken. In the event of a suspension of certification, ARSO Secretariat shall be notified.
A suspension can be revoked after an additional audit whose outcome provides evidence all NCs have been corrected. This shall take place within 90 days, otherwise the certification is revoked. The costs of the additional audit shall be covered by the firm. In the time period between the suspension of the certification and the cancellation of the suspension, the product will not be considered compliant to the African standards.
70 © ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
The revocation of certificate causes the immediate prohibition of the use of the certificate by the company and/or the withdrawal of all certificates of membership. The decision of revocation and the related reasons shall be communicated to the company and ARSO Secretariat.
The CB shall have clear procedures for receiving, processing and investigating complaints concerning and from certified companies, as well as appeals of non-compliances of certification decisions in relation to the standards valid at the time of the audit.
F.6 Minimum qualifications of auditing staff
F.6.1 Auditing staff for ARS/AES 2, aquaculture and chain of custody shall have the following minimum knowledge and experience:
a) Knowledge of ACAP documentation related to the certification scheme under audit, achieved through successful completion of a course officially recognised by ARSO Secretariat. The course shall include updated current best practices for fisheries and/or aquaculture.
b) Knowledge of the ISO 19011 standard and proficiency in the related techniques and methodologies. Particularly, the CB shall ensure that the auditing staff complete a course on this subject of at least 8 hours.
c) Knowledge of the processes related to the certification scheme under audit and sufficient knowledge of the related products/services, including legal requirements.
These skills may be concentrated in one single auditor or they can be distributed among several staff members of the audit team.
d) A high school diploma or equivalent is necessary and for the following certification criteria are required:
▪
For aquaculture: minimum one-year work experience in the technical or production department of an aquaculture company;
▪
For wild capture fisheries: minimum one-year work experience in the technical or production department of a fishing company or a seafood processing company;
▪
For sustainable fish feed, fishmeal, fish oil: minimum two years of work experience in the food industry.
Alternatively, the auditing staff shall have one of the following university degrees: Biology, Marine Biology, Chemistry, Veterinary, or similar degree in food technology or food safety, and should carry out the following as a trainee auditor:
▪
For aquaculture: three audits of aquaculture sites (ARS/AES 5, ARS/AES 6 or in alternative Friend of the Sea, Global GAP Aquaculture, Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA), Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) audit experience or other similar schemes);
▪
For wild capture fisheries: three audits of fishing activities (ARS/AES 2 or in alternative Friend of the Sea or Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) audit experience or other similar schemes);
▪
For sustainable fish feed, fishmeal, fish oil: three audits of food processing activities.
In all cases, the candidate shall have successfully completed at least one audit as “auditor in training” of the standard he/she is being qualified for under the supervision of a qualified auditor.

When any changes in the requirements for assessing CBs are applied, the CBs have up to six months to come into compliance, as a transitional period. In addition, the CBs have the option to apply for exceptions with a valid justification (e.g. by demonstrating that the number of auditors is not sufficient).
The CB shall provide a Curriculum Vitae of all auditors selected for assessing companies against seafood standards prior to their first audit. Specific template shall be used.
Once ARSO receives all the requested documents and approve them, the auditor shall undertake the audit(s) training. The CB shall communicate when the process is completed and then ARSO shall issue an official statement.
The CB shall provide a Competence evaluation of all the auditors selected for assessing companies against seafood standards.
The Competence evaluation shall include the following items:
▪
An evaluation of knowledge and skills for each fundamental area the auditor will be expected to be working;
▪
An evaluation of knowledge of pertinent fishery and/or aquaculture programs and the ability to access and be able to apply relevant laws and regulations;
▪
An evaluation of the personal attributes of the auditor, to ensure they conduct themselves in a professional manner;
▪
A period of supervision to covering fishery and/or aquaculture principles, specific audit techniques and specific category knowledge;
▪
A documented sign off by the certification body of the satisfactory completion of evaluation requirements.
The CB shall provide every two years, starting from the date of the first submission, an updated Competence evaluation of all the auditors assessing companies against seafood standards.
F.6.2 Specific requirements for CoC
The auditors in charge of CoC shall have the knowledge and experience listed in F.6.1 (a, b, c, and d) and shall have completed at least five CoC audits as a trainee for chain of custody standards (including the three audits for sustainable fish feed, fishmeal, fish oil as mentioned above) or in alternative Friend of Sea, Global GAP, Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA), ISO 22000, British Retail Consortium (BRC), International Featured Standards (IFS), ISO 22005 or other recognized schemes.
F.7 Standards in introduction and revision
ARSO shall notify any change to standards, certification and accreditation procedures to ABs, CBs, and companies/ firms. The updates are sent to all accredited CBs as official communications. It is the responsibility of the CBs to inform their staff of such updates.
When the competent AB revises a new version of the current certification standards, the firms are allowed a transitional period (36 months for the wild capture standard and 12 months for all the other standards) from the date of publication of the standard to come into compliance. During this period both standards versions are considered valid, while the new version becomes compulsory at the end of the transitional period, as defined for that standard revision. In the case of modifications that require considerable investments by the firms, the length of the transitional period can be extended for an additional time span of six months. The additional time request shall be submitted by the CBs with a valid justification.

F.8 Sample’s temporal and spatial distribution
Friend of the Sea does not indicate to the CBs a fee structure in order to determine the audit costs, since they are highly variable. However, each CB shall specify to its potential customers its own fee structure in a non-discriminatory manner, detailing how the costs are calculated and considering the special circumstances and requirements of developing countries and countries in transition. The written fee structure shall be made available upon request and adequate to support accurate and truthful audits commensurate with the scale, size and complexity of the fishery, fish farm or chain of custody. The initial audits shall include onsite visits.
The following procedure allows to understand how potential operating costs are calculated:
F.8.1 Certification of ARS/AES 2
The number of man-days necessary to carry out the audit depends on the size of the company and fishery being audited. If the fleet meets all the following similarities, only the square root (see Table F.1) of the total number of vessels supplying the company to be certified shall be inspected:
▪
All fishing vessels use the same fishing method;
▪
All fishing vessels use the same catching capacity per vessel (±40%);
▪
All fishing vessels operate in the same fishing area (intended as FAO or ICES area, depending on the reference area for the audit of the stock status of the species under consideration);
▪
All fishing vessels are managed uniformly by the same shipowner or under the same regulation.
To ensure that costs are kept to a minimum, the number of vessels to be inspected is determined using the calculation in Table F.1. Vessels already certified for other companies (common fleet) can be included in the certification scope but shall not be considered in the calculation of vessels to be inspected. The method for the calculation of the number of man-days required is outlined in Table F.2.

A day of audit is comprised of 8 hours, excluding travel time. The indications in Table F.2 correspond to the minimum allowable audit time.
Other factors may affect audit times:
a) Management complexity, as reported by the CB through the collection of information about the company;
b) Complexity of the environmental legislation and regulations, e.g. simplifications due to a very restrictive legislation, with strict controls of single properties, complications due to a lax legislation and rare controls;
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
c) Complexity of the organisation, e.g. simplifications due to the existence of documents and controls by the Public Administration, i.e. application of the principle of subsidiarity; complications of the controls due to the complex organisation of firm;
d) Other factors, such as delays in fishing vessels returning to port and during transhipment operations.
Exceptional cases:
1. Audit in remote areas:
When the onsite audit is not immediately possible because of remote geographical location or temporal constrictions of the fishing activity, a documental audit can be considered acceptable only if the vessels to be audited are equipped with full-time closed-circuit TVs (CCTVs) system on board and digital logbooks, that can provide the evidence of standard compliancy. The firm shall also engage to undergo onsite audit during the fishing season or as soon as the fishing vessels return to port.
Off-site documental audits may be carried out when the fishing vessels do not land for periods longer than 6 months or when the landing ports are located in areas that are not accessible for the auditing staff.
2. Unavailability of vessels:
In the case of unavailability of vessels at port (e.g. due to delays in landing or other impediments), the CB shall perform remotely the complete audit of the unavailable vessels included in the sample to inspect. This implies the review of all the documents and supporting evidences requested by the standard (e.g. fishing licences, boat registrations, logbooks, procedures) for all the vessels in the samples. The complete audit of vessels shall be performed during the following audit (i.e. surveillance or recertification).
F.8.2 Certification to aquaculture standards
The number of working days necessary to carry out an audit is proportional to the number of aquaculture sites and the number and complexity of the processing factories to be inspected. If all aquaculture sites operate within the same management system and same farming practices, the number of sites inspected will be the square root of the total number of sites, as outlined in Table F.3. The method for the calculation of working days is outlined in Table F.4.

b) Management complexity, as reported by the CB through the collection of information about the company;
c) Complexity of the environmental legislation and regulations, e.g. simplifications due to a very restrictive legislation, with strict controls of single properties; complications due to lax legislation and rare controls;
d) Complexity of the organisation, e.g. simplifications due to the existence of documents and controls by the Public Administration, i.e. application of the principle of subsidiarity; complications of the controls due to the complex organisation of firm;
e) Other factors.
Exceptional cases:
In case the audit of offshore plants is not possible due to adverse weather conditions, a documental audit may be considered acceptable if the firm is able to provide evidence of compliance to all requirements related to the production site management. The firm shall also engage to undergo onsite audit during the following surveillance audit.
F.8.3 Certification of CoC
The number of working days necessary to carry out the audit is proportional to the number of certification items and, above all, to the number of suppliers involved in the sourcing process and to the source(s) of the product.
If all processing sites (permanent locations where organizations carry out production processes) operate under the control of a single entity (multi-site organisations), the number of sites inspected will be the square root of the total number of sites (Table F.3). The minimum audit time required for sustainable fish feed, fishmeal, fish oil and chain of custody certifications is summarised in Table F.5.

A day of audit is comprised of 8 hours, excluding travel time. The indications in Table F.5 correspond to the minimum allowable audit time. All processing sites shall be audited during the period of validity of the certificate (three years).
Other factors may affect audit times:
a) Possible integration with Global G.A.P. Aquaculture;
b) Management complexity, as reported by the CB through the collection of information about the company.
F.8.4 Certification of operators and processors groups
▪
The number of man-days necessary to carry out the audit depends on the size of the operator group being audited and of its members.
▪
If all members of a fishery group meet the homogeneity criteria defined for fishing fleets (A1), only the square root (see Table 1) of the total number of vessels supplying the company to be certified shall be inspected.
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
▪
In the case of a group of aquaculture operators, the number of operators/sites to be audited is equivalent to the square root of the current number of operators/production sites operating with the same management system.
▪
Procedures for auditing methods and frequency of audits shall take into consideration risk factors to decide in which cases more audits are necessary. Anyway, all firms shall undergo at least one surveillance audit during the certification cycle (3 years). CBs can use their own judgment to determine risk factors and shall document it.
▪
For audit timing, refer to paragraphs from F.8.1 to F.8.4.
▪
The CB shall inspect the complete checklist (Essential, Important and Recommended requirements) of the applicable standard(s) during all audits.
Surveillance Audits
The duration of the surveillance audit shall be 1/3 of the duration of the initial certification audit and shall be greater than 0.5 days. One third of the fishing vessels/farm sites/processing sites inspected during the initial certification audits shall be visited during the surveillance audits. These shall be selected amongst those that were not inspected during the previous audit(s), when possible. The surveillance audits shall include onsite visits.
Recertification Audits
Recertification audits shall have a duration of 2/3 of the initial certification audit. Two thirds of the fishing vessels/farm sites/processing sites inspected during the initial certification audits shall be inspected during the recertification audits. These shall be selected amongst those that were not inspected during the previous audit(s), when possible. The recertification audits shall include onsite visits.
Additional Audits
Additional audits (i.e. unscheduled audits due to the detection of major NCs) can have a shorter duration that shall be proportional to the importance of the NC or to the specific case and shall be justified by the CB. Firms that have been certified before official accreditation of ACAP schemes shall be verified by means of a first certification audit at recertification.
Unannounced Audits
The duration of the unannounced audit shall be 1/3 of the duration of the initial certification audit and shall be greater than 0.5 days. One third of the fishing vessels/farm sites/processing sites inspected during the initial certification audit shall be visited during the unannounced audits. These shall be selected amongst those that were not inspected during the previous audit(s), when possible. The unannounced audits shall include onsite visits.

Annex G (normative) Scheme G: Good financial grant practice certification
The objective of this standard for Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP) is to standardize, simplify and strengthen the financial governance of grant funding. For grantors, they can use the standard as a minimum requirement to their grantees. For grantees, they can claim compliance with this standard to support applications for grants from grantors. This standard is to establish a consistent approach to the management of grants throughout the grant life cycle, for the benefit of grantors and grantees.
Operating in compliance to the standard should:
(a) reduce the cost and administration time for both grantors and grantees;
(b) reduce the multitude of audits and financial audits that grantees have from different grantors;
(c) increase the confidence of grantors to fund directly to grantees;
(d) reduce the risk of corruption, bribery and fraud; and
(e) enable targeted financial capacity building by grantors
This standard is designed to codify and provide requirements on established good practice. It is a quality standard and not an accounting standard. The GFGP standard provides a common framework for how grantees shall financially manage grants. It provides details of the requirements, specifications and criteria to be applied, to implement good financial grant practice.
Grantors and grantees are very diverse in nature, and range from:
(a) very large to very small;
(b) straightforward to very complex;
(c) short to longer term in nature;
(d) operating in safe to risky environments;
(e) having different levels of risk they are willing to accept;
(f) government to private foundations and individual entities;
(g) national to regional to international in nature; and
(h) mature to new and emerging.
The standard is designed to be inclusive of all the above by having four tiers from bronze to platinum. Table 1 is illustrative only and gives some indication of the types of organizations that might fit into each tier.
The tiers are cumulative from bronze through to platinum. Therefore, for an organization to achieve silver compliance, it will be required to comply with all of the requirements within the bronze and silver tiers. For an organization to achieve gold compliance, the organization will be required to comply with all of the requirements within the bronze, silver and gold tiers. To achieve platinum compliance, the organization will be required to comply with all of the requirements in this standard.
The four tiers have been designed to encourage grantees to progressively strengthen their financial grant practices as their organization develops.
ACAP 1-2:2025
© ARSO 2025 — All rights reserved
The four tiers also enable grantors to manage their exposure to risk as some grantors may choose to specify grantees comply with a certain tier, or parts of a tier, depending on the size or nature of the grants that they manage and are responsible for. Grantors may, after an audit, decide to award the grant, even if the grantee does not meet their requirements and may mitigate their risk by putting in place additional financial controls, or provide capacity strengthening funding to bring the grantee up to the required level.
This standard addresses the principles of good financial grant practice, which are:
(ix)
accountability;
(x)
stewardship;
(xi)
compliance to standards;
(xii)
transparency;
(xiii)
viability;
(xiv)
integrity;
(xv)
consistency and
(xvi)
efficiency and effectiveness
Table G.2 — Organization activity indicative of GFGP tiers
In turn, these principles are supported by four key pillars of good financial management, which, if correctly applied, will provide the evidence to support compliance with good financial grant practice. These are:
(v)
Internal controls
(vi)
Record keeping
(vii)
Planning
(viii)
Monitoring
Further detail on both the principles of good financial grant practice and four key pillars of good financial management can be found in ARS 1651, Good financial grant practice — Requirements.
