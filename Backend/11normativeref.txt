As required by ACAP 1-1 Clause 1 and aligned with the AfCFTA Agreement Article 3 (Objectives) and WTO TBT Agreement Article 2.2, this certification procedure aims to facilitate intra-African trade while ensuring product safety and quality.
This procedure defines the roles, responsibilities, decision-making authority, compliance mechanisms, and accountability structures necessary to ensure the integrity, credibility, and consistent application of the marks across Africa and internationally, with specific attention to the diverse requirements of ACAP certification schemes (A- L).
1.2 Scope
Per ACAP 1-1 Clause 1 and in accordance with AfCFTA Annex 6 on Technical Barriers to Trade, this procedure covers:
•	Harmonized certification across AfCFTA member states
•	Mutual recognition of conformity assessment results in line with AfCFTA Annex 6 on Technical Barriers to Trade and WTO TBT Agreement Article 6.
•	Reduction of technical barriers to trade per WTO/TBT Agreement Preamble
This procedure applies to:
1.	ARSO Central Secretariat (Scheme Owner)
2.	ARSO Conformity Assessment Committee (CACO)
3.	ARSO Advisory Committee
4.	National Standards Bodies (NSBs) of ARSO Member States
5.	Approved Certification Bodies (CBs)
6.	Licensed Operators (Certified Clients)
7.	Accreditation Bodies (ABs) under AFRAC MRA

The ARSO Council, comprising the Heads/CEOs of National Standards Bodies (NSBs) of ARSO member states, acts as the supreme governing body for the strategic direction of the ACAP scheme. 
o	ARSO Constitution, Article 7 – Establishes the ARSO Council as the supreme governing body comprising Heads/CEOs of National Standards Bodies (NSBs) of Member States.
The ARSO Council provides the high-level mandate necessary to secure government commitment to the scheme across the continent.
1.	Strategic Oversight and Policy Ratification -The Council reviews and ratifies the certification rules and harmonization policies recommended by the Conformity Assessment Committee (CACO). It ensures these policies are consistent with national laws and regional regulations.
o	AfCFTA Annex 6, Article 13 (Cooperation):
"State Parties shall cooperate in the development and harmonization of standards... and conformity assessment procedures." 
2.	Facilitation of Mutual Recognition - The Council members (Heads of NSBs) are responsible for championing the acceptance of the ARSO Mark within their respective national jurisdictions, thereby reducing re-testing and re-certification.

It is responsible for the day-to-day management, implementation, promotion, and global representation of the ACAP scheme and the ARSO Marks. 
The Secretariat executes the strategic directives of the ARSO Council and the technical policies established by the Conformity Assessment Committee (CACO), ensuring the scheme operates efficiently, transparently, and with integrity across all member states.
o	ACAP 1-1:2025, Clause 6.1 – Responsibilities of the ARSO Central Secretariat.
Role and Authority
1. Operational Authority and Administration
The Secretariat executes the mandate of the Scheme Owner through the following critical functions:

5.2 Client Certification Process (From Application to Certification)
5.2.1 Purpose
To define the standardized steps a client (manufacturer, processor, producer) follows to obtain certification for its products/processes under an ACAP scheme, ensuring consistency and integrity.
5.2.2 Process Stages:
5.2.2.1 Preparation & Application:
•	The client selects an Approved Certification Body (CB) from the public register.
•	The client submits a formal application (ACAP Form CL-01) to the chosen CB, detailing product(s), manufacturing site(s), and applicable ARS standard(s).
•	The CB reviews the application for completeness, conducts a preliminary document review (e.g., of product specifications, test reports), and provides a quotation.
5.2.2.2 Contract & Audit Planning:
•	Upon acceptance of the quotation, the client and CB sign a certification contract.
•	The CB develops a detailed audit plan, including the scope, criteria, audit team, and dates for Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits.
5.2.2.3 Stage 1 Audit (Documentation Review & Readiness Assessment):
•	Conducted on-site or remotely to review the client's management system documentation, evaluate readiness for Stage 2, and understand processes and site conditions.
•	Focuses on conformity with the relevant ARS standard(s) and regulatory requirements.
5.2.2.4 Stage 2 Audit (On-Site Evaluation of Implementation):
•	A detailed on-site audit to evaluate the effective implementation of the management system and conformity of products/processes to the ARS standard(s).
•	Includes witnessing of production, inspection of facilities, testing of products (or review of test reports from accredited labs), and interviews with personnel.
5.2.2.5 Audit Report & Corrective Actions:
•	The audit team issues a report detailing findings (conformities and non-conformities).
•	The client must address any major non-conformities within an agreed timeframe (typically 90 days). The CB verifies the effectiveness of corrective actions.

•	Upon positive decision, the CB:
1.	Issues the ACAP Certificate of Conformity (with a unique ID number).
2.	Enters the certificate details into the ACAP Digital Platform (triggering its appearance in the public register).
3.	Grants a sub-license to the client for the use of the ARSO Mark on the certified products, per Chapter 6 rules.
5.2.3 Reference: ACAP 1-1:2025, Clause 10; ACAP 1-2:2025; ISO/IEC 17065:2021, Clause 7.

5.3.1 Purpose
To ensure continued conformity of certified clients and the integrity of the ARSO Mark through ongoing oversight between certification cycles.
5.3.2 Surveillance Audits
5.3.2.1 Frequency: Conducted at least annually, following a surveillance plan established by the CB. The first surveillance audit must occur within 12 months of initial certification.
5.3.2.2 Scope: Covers critical aspects of the management system and product conformity. May be shorter in duration than the initial audit but must be sufficient to verify ongoing compliance.
5.3.2.3 Unannounced Audits: The CB may conduct a percentage of surveillance audits unannounced, based on a risk assessment, to enhance scheme integrity.
5.3.3 Re-assessment (Recertification)
5.3.3.1 Cycle: Conducted every three (3) years, prior to the expiry of the current certificate.
5.3.3.2 Process: Similar in rigor to the initial certification process, including a full review of the client's system and performance over the certification cycle. It may include a review of complaints, changes, and surveillance results.
5.3.3.3 Timing: The re-assessment audit must be completed sufficiently before the certificate expiry date to allow for decision-making and potential corrective actions. A certificate remains valid pending the re-assessment decision.
5.3.4 Actions Following Surveillance/Re-assessment:

•	Minor Non-conformities: Client must correct within an agreed timeframe; CB verifies.
•	Major Non-conformities: May lead to suspension (see 5.6) if not addressed promptly and effectively.

Major Extension: New product line, significant process change, or new site. Requires an audit equivalent to a relevant portion of the initial certification process.
5.4.2.3 Decision & Update: Upon satisfactory evaluation, the CB updates the certificate scope and the ACAP Digital Platform register.
5.4.3 Scope Reduction: Client voluntarily removes a product, process, or site from the certificate, or the CB imposes reduction due to non-conformity.
•	Process must be documented, with updated certificate issued and public register amended.
5.4.4 Reference: ISO/IEC 17065:2021, Clause 7.10.

5.6 Suspension, Withdrawal, and Restoration of Certification
5.6.1 Suspension: Temporary invalidation of the certificate.
5.6.1.1 Grounds: Including but not limited to: failure to correct major non-conformities, refusal to facilitate surveillance/re-assessment, misuse of mark (Chapter 6.7), or a voluntary request by the client.
